## September 28 ([discuss](https://github.com/webpack/meeting-notes/pull/15))

### Attendees

* [Sean Larkin](http://github.com/thelarkinn)
* [Juho Vepsäläinen](http://github.com/bebraw)

#### Attendee Notes

* Both Johannes and Tobias are on vacation. Tobias will be joining us again next month.

### Agenda

#### Documentation Updates

* Interestingly few people spoke out to switching from [antwar](https://github.com/antwarjs/antwar) to something else (found in [last weeks](https://github.com/webpack/meeting-notes/pull/14) meeting notes).

  * Sean: Personally disagree with the timing, if someone does it, it needs to be a fully vetted PR that we would be pretty rigid with. Thinks that we need as many people focusing on the content instead. 

  * Juho: Open to PR’s but would also come the responsibility of daily, continuous maintenance of the [webpack/webpack.js.org](github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) project.

* Sean: Will also start working on concepts/plugins section for documentation

* Sean: We should tackle Plugins in 3 ways: 

  * Concepts: high level, anatomy, usage

  * How-to: plugins use for specific cases

  * API: anatomy of tapable, tapable instances, event hooks, compiler lifecycle, supporting packages

* Documentation at 50% for milestone

### Takeaways  
* Documentation
