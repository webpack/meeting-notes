## June 29 ([discuss](https://github.com/webpack/meeting-notes/pull/2))

### Attendees

* [Tobias Koppers](http://github.com/sokra)
* [Johannes Ewald](http://github.com/jhnns)
* [Sean Larkin](http://github.com/thelarkinn)
* [Juho Vepsäläinen](http://github.com/bebraw)

### Agenda

#### Repo Management Tools

* Discussed briefly using Github management tools to help:
  * Move issues between repos:
  * Apply Issues to multiple repos: 
  * Track and coordinate milestones across repos:
  
#### Documentation

* Tobias worked on an [outline](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.io/commit/18b7f14d686b76775d1b5de763423d121bc28f0b) that could serve as a foundation for webpack/webpack.io. 
* Had one or two volunteers express interest in working on documentation however we will want to have a handful of folks working on documentation. (Because there is a lot to document).
* Suggestions were made to create individual issues for each of the "topics or features" for webpack so that we can easily track our progress. 
* Sean is still looking for a company who specializes in content creation etc. to help donate their efforts if possible.
* We will start to tag issues in github that we have answered/found useful for people with the `documentation` tag so that we can address them in the future documentation

#### Releasing Webpack 2.x Official

* Sean has created a filter of [current reported issues](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3Awebpack-2+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22in+planning%22) that Tobias is going to look through to see if it has been already fixed, or if it is by design/not a bug, etc. 
* We agreed that a 2.x RC/Official Release milestone will be created that will assist us in tracking what remains. This will propose somewhat of a challenge because there is webpack/webpack-dev-server and other repo's to ensure are up to date to any breaking changes. 
* Also working on PR Issues, support for problems from @gaearon and @gdi2290 (Strong representatives from the Angular and React communities).
* In the end Documentation for [webpack/webpack.io](http://github.com/webpack/webpack.io) will be the **critical blocker**. Otherwise, only easy/small features/bugs remain.
* Backporting the --env `function` style webpack config definition so that transition is easier for users can use the feature if desired going from webpack 1.x to webpack 2.x. 

#### Releasing After Webpack 2.x Official

* Adding an InlinePlugin (name TBD) that will support RollUp style inlining of modules for ES6 tree shaking capabilities. But requires core changes and should happen after 2.x release. 
* 

#### Public awareness

* In addition to adding the meeting-notes as public Tobias brought up the idea of a Medium publication that all of the core team members can post on. The 'voice' of webpack tailored by the community's needs and wants. The Content will contain: 
  * Looking for maintainers for some repos
  * Webpack 2 release plan
  * Documentation plan
  * Slack
  * Sponsor/Donations plan
  * Team members
  * Thanks to loader authors
  * Ask what people expect from a webpack blog
* We want people to know that webpack 2.x not only represents a change in the code, but also dev community involvement, transparency, and support. #Webpack <3 #Developers

### Takeaways

* Backport --env
* Create a medium publication (tobias/sean)

  * karma-webpack
  * coffee-loader
  * component-webpack-plugin
  * grunt-webpack
  * mocha-loader
  * html-loader
  * compression-webpack-plugin
  * i18n-webpack-plugin
  * transform-loader
  * jshint-loader
  * json5-loader
  * coffee-redux-loader
  * coverjs-loader
* Work on Standardized TypeScript loader/plugins if authors are willing CC @jbrantly & @s-panferov (Sean)
* Create 2.0 Typings team to work with documentation team and changes to accurately be reflected in the typedefs (Sean) 

### Common Questions

1. How does one do targeted webpack builds? 
Targeted webpack builds mean that you have multiple builds created for different devices, browser and support. Using tools like [parallel-webpack](http://tech.trivago.com/2015/12/15/parallel-webpack/) allows you to build multiple configurations in parallel. The example on [parallel-webpack](https://github.com/trivago/parallel-webpack#variants-example)'s github repository is a great example.

2. How does `LoaderOptionsPlugin` replace `UglifyJsPlugin` for minification. 
The `LoaderOptionsPlugin` delegates the minification and optimization to the loader itself. Therefore if the loader doesn't implement the properties (for 2.x) then nothing will happen. https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7#loader-options--minimize
