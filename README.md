# Webpack Core Meeting Notes

The Webpack Core team meets once a week to discuss the development of Webpack, future plans, and priorities.  
These notes are very new and started June, 2016.

New notes will be added as pull requests so you will be notified of them if you watch the repo.  
You can comment on the pull requests to discuss the notes, or raise issues if you would like to ask for a clarification.

The repo format is inspired by [React Core Notes](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes) which was inspired by [Ember Core Notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes).
