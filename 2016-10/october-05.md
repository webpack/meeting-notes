## October 05 ([discuss](https://github.com/webpack/meeting-notes/pull/15))

### Attendees

* [Sean Larkin](http://github.com/thelarkinn)
* [Juho Vepsäläinen](http://github.com/bebraw)
* [Johannes Ewald](http://github.com/jhnns)
* [Kees Kluskens](https://github.com/SpaceK33z)

### Agenda

#### Consideration of New Core Team Member

  * Sean: Kees's work on [webpack-dev-server](http://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) and [webpack-dev-middleware](http://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) has been impressive and he has continued to offer to help even as these two large repo's themself have been well maintained. This alone is justifyable. 

  * Everyone was in agreeance that Kees is suited. Officially adding him as a member to the webpack core team. 

  * In addition, will give him opportunity to maintain other repo's in the organization if willing. Wanting his focus to still be on webpack-dev-server and webpack-dev-middleware, and only taking on what he can handle, as we have been more than happy with the work he has done. 

  * When Tobias gets back from vacation we will add official privileges on the org and repo.

#### Documentation Updates

  * What to do with [Gatsby PR](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/pull/202)?

    * Concerns? 
      
      * Sean: Antwar is custom tailored/made for docs page. Switching to something else and relying on specific changes for our docs page: Could they be timely and not affect other tools relying on Gatsby? Things to discuss when we finish milestone. 
        
      * Johannes: Timing is bad to accept for now (we do not want to stop current momentum we have on content creation).

    * We want to encourage this contribution still. Will discuss having the PR broken into multiple PR's (1 for styling, another for the underlying framework change). This way we can potentially accept a styling PR without too much distraction.

    * The entire team agreed to communicate this PR split as well as freezing the underlying framework until we reach our documentation milestone. 

  * Documentation milestone now [57%!!!!](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/milestone/1)

  * Add more love to the Migration from 1 to 2 doc. Should include as much as possible from the original ["Whats new in webpack 2"](https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7) doc that Tobias authored as there is good content there. 

  * Will also publish article that has a call to action on the final push of docs work. (Juho)

#### Logo license

  * Juho: We will use the [Blender License as a blueprint](https://www.blender.org/about/license/).

  * Johannes: Should include that the font for our [new logo](http://github.com/webpack/media) is not available under the license.

  * Should also decide legally how to handle the font in the license.
